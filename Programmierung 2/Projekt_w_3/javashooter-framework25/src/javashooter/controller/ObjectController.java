/**
 * Class that controls the LOGICAL behavior of an object independently of how it
 * is displayed or drawn. The most important method here is
 * {@link #updateObject}: this method is, by various indirections, called
 * exactly once per game time step for every object that is on the
 * javashooter.playground. It has, by virtue of the member variable
 * {@link gameObject} (of type {@link GameObject}), full access to
 * <ul>
 * <li>the object it is controlling
 * <li>the javashooter.playground this object belongs to
 * </ul>
 * Typically, updateObject would check whether an object leaves the screen to
 * react appropriately. In that case the object can be marked for deletion (by
 * adding it to the flag "deleted" that is always defined for any
 * javashooter.playground), but of course other reactions are possible like
 * rebounding, emerging on the other side, ...
